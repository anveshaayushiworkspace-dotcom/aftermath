# AFTERMATH

AFTERMATH is a simple web app for **tracking college campus issues until they are actually resolved**, not just reported.

The project was **built with the assistance of AI tools**, and also **uses AI in a limited, support-only role inside the app**.

---

## What It Does

AFTERMATH helps students and admins:
- Record campus issues (hostel, mess, Wi-Fi, infrastructure)
- Track the status of each issue
- View admin updates
- Confirm whether an issue is actually resolved

The focus is **visibility and follow-up**, not automation.

---

## How It Works

### Student
- Logs in
- Submits an issue
- Views issue status and updates
- Manually escalates if needed
- Confirms when the issue is resolved

### Admin
- Views all reported issues
- Updates issue status
- Marks an issue as resolved (pending student confirmation)

 An issue is closed **only after student confirmation**.

---

## Role of AI in the Application

AI (Google Gemini) is used **only for support**:
- Summarizes issue descriptions
- Helps admins quickly understand reported problems

AI does **not**:
- Detect issues automatically
- Escalate complaints
- Make decisions
- Flag issues on its own

All actions are **manual and human-controlled**.

---

## Use of AI During Development

AI tools were used during development to:
- Assist with code generation and debugging
- Help design system flow and architecture
- Improve documentation and clarity

The final decisions, logic, and implementation were **done and verified by the team**.

## Tech Stack

## Project Status

This is an **MVP built for a hackathon**.

## Core Idea

AFTERMATH does not solve problems automatically.  
It ensures problems **do not disappear without accountability**.
